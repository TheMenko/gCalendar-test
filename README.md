testing email password: Test123!  

What currently works:  
* Form and form validation (basic js validation and laravel validation)  
* Communication with google calendar api - possible to creatre events  


What currently doesn't work:  
* Setting attendees in event (issue with Domain-wide delegation)  
* Notifications  

note: The code is there for both attendees and reminders and it "should"  
work, however GSuite is not set properly unfortunately.
